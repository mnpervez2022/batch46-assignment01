//Magicians: Make a array of magician’s names. Pass the array to a function called show_magicians(), which prints the 
//name of each magician in the array.

// let arrayMagician= ["Asif","Mustafa","Amir","Shahid","Qamar"];
// function show_magicians(Name:string[]):void{
// for (let c = 0; c< arrayMagician.length; c++){
//     console.log(` Magician No ${c+1} Name ${arrayMagician[c]}`)
// }
// }
// show_magicians(arrayMagician);

//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 41. Write a function called make_great()
// that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magician’s name. Call 
//show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
